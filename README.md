The task is to use scrapy framework to scrape the first 500 items (title, image url) from sreality.cz (flats, sell) and save the data in the Postgresql database. 

The next step is implementing a simple HTTP server in Python, which will show these 500 items on a simple page (title and image).  

Everything can be run using a "docker-compose up" command. 

The scraped ads can be found on the following page http://127.0.0.1:8080.
